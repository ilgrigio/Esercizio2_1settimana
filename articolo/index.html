        <h1>Our delicious honey</h1>
        <p>
          Honey produced in the mountains is some of the most delicious you will
          ever taste. Three types of mountain honeys are produced along Italy’s
          alpine arc: fir honeydew (melata d’abete), rhododendron (rododendro)
          and wildflower (millefiori). These are made only from nectar or
          honeydew gathered at altitudes higher than 1,200 meters. Producing
          honey at such high altitudes is not easy. Even on a good year, the
          yield is not generous. The Slow Food Presidium aims to help and
          protect the work of the few beekeepers who still carry out an
          itinerant honey production around the Alpine meadows. Nomadism is
          rarely practiced today as it is less profitable, yet it produces
          excellent honey products. As described on the Slow Food Presidium’s
          website, fir honeydew is dark, almost black, and has a slightly
          resinous scent which evokes burnt wood and caramelized sugar, with
          malted, balsamic notes. The rhododendron and wildflower honeys are
          fresher and more delicate. Both are pale, with a subtle fragrance that
          recalls berry jams. Paired with cheese, honey should not be
          crystallized; rather, use the bain-marie method to liquefy it.
          Honeydew, which is intense and balsamic, pairs well with medium-aged
          cheeses; rhododendron and wildflower, which are sweeter, pair well
          with more pungent cheeses, such as aged pecorino. Honey is produced in
          the summer months, but is available all year round.
